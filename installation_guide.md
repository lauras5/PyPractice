# Installation Guide

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up your environment to run the Python Beginner Tutorial Series. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter installed on your machine before starting.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/): The Python programming language.
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install): An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install Python

Download and install the latest version of Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 2. Install Jupyter

Once Python is installed, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install Jupyter using `pip`:

```
pip install jupyter
```
### 3. Clone or Download the Repository
Clone or download this repository to your local machine. You can use the following command if you have Git installed:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
```
### 4. Navigate to the Repository
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you cloned or downloaded the repository:

```
cd path/to/your-repo
```

### 5. Open Jupyter Notebooks
Run the following command to start the Jupyter Notebook server:
```
jupyter notebook
```

Your default web browser will open, displaying the Jupyter Notebook interface. Navigate to the tutorial files (e.g., 01_introduction_to_python.ipynb) and open them to get started.


## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during the installation process, refer to the official documentation for Python and Jupyter for troubleshooting guidance.
